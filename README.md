This repository contains the completed tasks for the CodSoft Java Development Internship. The internship focused on developing practical Java applications, and the following three tasks were successfully implemented:

1.  **Student Grade Calculator**
2.  **Currency Converter**
3.  **ATM Interface**


## Task 1: Student Grade Calculator

This application calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade to a student based on marks obtained in multiple subjects.

**Features:**

*   Takes input of marks for various subjects.
*   Calculates the sum of marks and average percentage.
